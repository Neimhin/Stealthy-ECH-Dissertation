\chapter{Design}
\label{chap:Design}

We aim to design stealthy \ac{SNI} and \ac{ALPN} encryption schemes based
on the basic premise that the 32 octets of the client \var{random}
along with the 32 octets of the \varlegacysessionid{} act as `cover',
which can be replaced with random-looking ciphertext.
There are other fields and extensions to the \ac{CH} message
which could provide additional cover,
but the \var{random} and \varlegacysessionid{}
provide cover of the highest quality; they are always present in a \ac{TLS} 1.3 \ac{CH},
their lengths do not vary between implementations, and they will not
need to be \ac{GREASE}'d.
The designs presented below leverage only these 64 octets of cover in the \ac{CH},
as well as the 32 octets of cover provided by the \ac{SH}\var{.random}.

\section{Discussion of RFC8744 Requirements}

In RFC 8744 \cite{rfc8744-issues} lay out a set of issues and design requirements pertaining to \ac{SNI} encryption, and the aim of this dissertation is design an \ac{SNI} encryption scheme that prioritises the requirement: ``Do Not Stick Out". However, a stealthy \ac{SNI} encryption scheme should of course also fulfill the other requirements listed by \cite{rfc8744-issues} where possible. Here we discuss these requirements and possible approaches to fulfilling them.


We discuss the requirement to "Mitigate Cut-and-Paste Attacks" in more detail in Section~\ref{sec:cut-and-paste-attacks}.

\subsection{Avoid Widely Shared Secrets}

\ac{ECH} avoids widely shared secrets through the use of \ac{PKC},
which is the approach we also adopt for
\ac{SECH} 3.

Our design \ac{SECH} 2
could be deployed with a widely shared secret,
which we recommend against.
As an alternative to sharing the secret
we have designed a bootstrapping mechanism
based on \ac{PSK}s.


\subsection{Enable Multi-Party Security Contexts}
This requirements is about securely allowing the separation of the client-facing server and the backend server. In particular the protocol should protect the client from \ac{MITM} attacks.

We can imagine a na√Øve design where a client-facing server terminates the \ac{TLS} connection.
This means the client-facing server has to possess the relevant certificate's private key and produce the \ac{CV}.
The servername could be indicated stealthily somehow, e.g. by prefixing it to the application data,
and then the true application data is relayed in the clear (or protected by some other means) to the backend server.
In this design the client never authenticates the backend server, which means the client-facing server can act as a \ac{MITM} and delete, modify, reorder messages to/from the backend server without the client or backend server being able to detect these modifications.


\cite{rfc8744-issues} also point out that backend-server authentication is not sufficient,
and that the client-facing server should also be authenticated.

\ac{ECH} mitigates against \ac{MITM}
by having the client authenticate
the backend server using the regular
\ac{TLS} 1.3 mechanisms,
but additionally there is an implicit authentication that the client-facing server owns the \var{ECHConfig},
i.e. it has the corresponding private key
(In order for the server
to produce the \ac{ECH} \var{accept\-\_confirmation} signal
it has to successfully decrypt the \ac{ECH} payload.).
The cleartext of the payload is hard to 
guess because it contains a 32 octet random,
which makes it hard for an attacker
to fraudulently authenticate as the client-facing server.

\ac{ECH} does not perform encryption of the secret \ac{SNI} parameter in the channel between
the client-facing and backend server,
which means this channel has to be protected
by some other means,
e.g. with a \ac{VPN} or a separate \ac{TLS} connection. The same is true for \ac{SECH}.

\cite{esni} distinguish two modes of operation for \ac{ECH}, shared mode and split-mode.
In shared mode there is a single server which performs the \ac{ECH} decryption {\em and} terminates the \ac{TLS} connection,
whereas in split-mode there is a client-facing server that performs \ac{ECH} decryption and which proxies the remaining \ac{TLS} traffic to and from a backend server which terminates the \ac{TLS} connection.
For \ac{ECH} each server is `aware' of its role in the ongoing connection.
The server can have a different role for different connections,
but within the context of a single connection the server determines its role based on the \var{type} field of the received \var{encrypted\_client\_hello} extension,
if the \var{type} is \var{outer} then the server is the client-facing server,
if it is \var{inner} the server is the backend server.

Figure~\ref{fig:sech-split-mode-accept} shows sequence diagram depicting the flow of messages in split-mode.

\label{fig:sech-split-mode-accept}
\end{figure}

For \ac{SECH} we don't have the luxury of setting
a cleartext \var{type} field to help the server
distinguish its role.
The approach we'll adopt below is to set the \ac{SNI} extension value in the \ac{CHI} to all 0s
as a signal that the server should act as a backend server.
The true \ac{SNI} is encoded elsewhere in the \ac{CHI}.

The motivations for split-mode are:
1. to distribute workload,
and 2. to enhance privacy for the backend server and the user
(the client-facing server can't see application traffic).

One reason for hesitance in deploying split-mode may be that there's low incentive for large providers.
The provider loses access to application traffic,
which means, for instance, it can't implement a \ac{WAF}.
Secondly the deployment and maintenance
of split-mode is more complex.

Issues around \ac{HRR} hijacking
make it challenging to design \ac{SECH}
while maintain stealth,
because it would require coordination of
two backend servers,
the backend server
corresponding to the outer \ac{SNI},
and the backend server corresponding to the inner \ac{SNI}.
Facilitating split-mode remains an open issue in our design.

\subsection{Prevent SNI-based DoS}
\cite{rfc8744-issues} note that in a split-mode deployment the client-facing server
may have more limited resources,
and so may be a target for \ac{SNI}-based \ac{DoS} attacks.
In shared-mode the argument is less relevant.

Our designs of \ac{SECH} 2 and \ac{SECH} 3
facilitate multiple \ac{SECH} keys
via trial decryption.
Increasing the number of keys increases
the cost of processing every \ac{CH} proportionally (whether or not the \ac{CH} is using \ac{SECH}).
In this sense our designs have failed to
fulfill the requirement to prevent
\ac{SNI}-based \ac{DoS}.
But, this can be mitigated by keeping
the number of enabled keys very small.

\subsection{Maintain Forward Secrecy}
Forward secrecy means that if the private key of one of the parties is compromised, then this
does not necessarily mean that
keys used in previous sessions are also compromised.
This is achieved in \ac{TLS} using {\em ephemeral} \ac{DH}.
The \ac{ECH} draft does not provide
forward secrecy of servername encryption because the long term private \ac{KEM} key is static.
The difficulty in providing forward secrecy
for \ac{ECH} is that the
servername ciphertext is sent in
the first flight of messages,
which makes it impossible to
negotiate ephemeral keys.

For \ac{SECH} 3 the case is the same,
but by using the \ac{PSK} bootstrapping
mechanism for \ac{SECH} 2 we achieve
forward secrecy.
This is possible because the \ac{PSK}
bootstrapping mechanism entails an additional previous handshake in which
an ephemeral key can be established.

\section{SECH Specifications}
Here we provide specifications for \ac{SECH} 2 (symmetric encryption only) and \ac{SECH} 3 (\ac{HPKE}-based encryption).
In a later section (\ref{sec:sech1}) we discuss \ac{SECH} 1, a design involving no secrets,
but we did not pursue a thorough design of \ac{SECH} 1 in this work.
